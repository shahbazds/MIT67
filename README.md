Description:
This is an implementation of MobileNet and NASNet feature vector APIs available on tensorflow hub™,	
In tensorflow. The feature vector returned by either of these APIs are fed into two fully connected layers
for classification. Both of these APIs are pre-trained image classification neural networks trained on 
ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The purpose was to evaluate their performance on indoor images as it is bigger 
challenge to classify indoor images due to similar spatial features.


MIT67 image database was used for these experiments.
